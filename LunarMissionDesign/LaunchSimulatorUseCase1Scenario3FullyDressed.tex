\textbf{Use Case 1: Monitor Pre-Launch}\\
\textbf{Scenrio:  }Monitor Delivery System--Monitor Rocket\\
\textbf{Scope:  }LaunchSimulator\\
\textbf{Level:  }Flight Controler Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }Flight Controller\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }None\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interrests:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item Flight Controller:  Wants to monitor the Rocket during
Pre-Launch for Pre-Launch Validity (coninue, hold or abort)
\item Engineer/Technicians:  Wants to monitor the Rocket during
Pre-Launch to aprise the Flight Controller to the condition of
Pre-Launch
\item Astronaut:  Wants to monitor the Rocket during Pre-Launch 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Pre-Conditions:  }The Countdown has started and in
Pre-Launch\\\\
\textbf{Post-Conditions:  }The Countdown at 0, the System transitioned
to Initiate Launch\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenorio: }\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{5.75cm}|p{5.75cm}|}\hline
\textbf{Flight Controller} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
& 1.  Reports the current velocity of the Rocket\\\hline
& 2.  Requests the State of the Current Stage\\\hline
& 3.  Returns the State of the Current Stage\\\hline
& 4.  Repeats 2 \& 3 for all Stages in the Rocket\\\hline
& 5.  Repeats 1-4 for the duration of the Countdown\\\hline
& 6.  For the Last Stage, reports the State of the Capsule\\\hline
& 7.  Reports Countdown at 0\\\hline
8.  Initiate Launch &\\\hline
& 9.  Transitions to Initiate Launch\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Alternative Flows:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[1a.]During the entire Countdown, the System reports any
velocity during Pre-Launch as anomalous.  Flight Controller determines
course of action (hold, abort or not abort).
\item[3a.]During the entire Countdown, If the System reports any
anomalous data related to any of the Stages, then the Flight Controller
determines the course of action (hold, abort or not abort).
item[6a.]Durring the entire Countdown, if the System reports any
anomoulous Capsule data, then the Flight Controller determines the
course of action (hold, abort, not abort)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Special Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item The System returns several data points for each
Stage (which makes up the Stage State). This data needs
documentation in related Use Case scenarios
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Technology \& Variations List:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Different Rockets will have different number of Stages
\item The Capsule differs based on mission
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Frequency of Occurrence:  }Dependant upon frequency of
Launch\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Is this writeup truthfully neccessary?
\end{itemize}
