\textbf{Use Case 1:  Request Mission Data}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Data Feeder\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }none\\
\textbf{Secondary Actor:  }(Lunar Mission)System\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }\textit{Use Case 2:  Request to Load a
Parameter File},\textit{Use Case 3:  Start the Data Feeder}\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interrests:  }
\begin{itemize}
   \item (Lunar Mission) System:  Requests Mission Data for current
      mission
   \item Flight Controller:  Wants a simulation with as similar as
      possible to an actual mission
   \item Engineers/Tecnincians:  Wants a simulation agnostic to source
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Pre-Conditions:  }Data Feeder is started, Parameter File is
loaded, Data Feeder is generating required mission data, (Lunaar
Mission) System is running.\\
\textbf{Post-Conditions:  }Requested Data Returned to the (Lunar
Mission) System\\\\
\textbf{Flow of Events:}\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{5.75cm}|p{5.75cm}|}\hline
\textbf{(Lunar Mission)System}&\textbf{Data Feeder}\\\hline
   1.  Request selected Mission Data &\\\hline
   & 2. Returns the requested data as Specified\\\hline
   3. Periodically loops back to \textit{1} for the durration of
   the Phase, State or Mission & \\\hline
   4. Stops collecting data upon completion of Phase, State or
   Mission & \\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Alternative Flows: }
\begin{itemize}
   \item[2a]If the data is not available, then the Data Feeder returns
      an error
   \item[2b]If the Data Feeder encounters an error while generating
      requested data, then the Data Feeder returns an error
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Special Requirements: }
\begin{itemize}
   \item None
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Open Issues}
\begin{itemize}
   \item[2a] If the querry rate is faster than the Data Feeder update
      rate, then the current queried data could be similar to the
      previous queried data.
\end{itemize}
