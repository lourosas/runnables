\textbf{Use Case 1:  Monitor Pre-launch}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Launch Simulator\\
\textbf{Level:  }Flight Controller Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }Flight Controller\\
\textbf{Secondary Actors:  }Astronaught, Engineer/Technician\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }\textit{Use Case 2:  the Flight
Controller Shall Monitor the Countdown}\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interrests:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item Flight Controller: wants to control the Pre-Launch Activities
\begin{itemize}
\item Control the Countdown Time \textit{See Use Case 2:  the Flght
Controller Shall Monitor the Countdown}
\item Monitor the Rocket
\item Monitor all the Stages in the Rocket
\item Monitor the Engines for each Stage
\item Monitor the Fuel System for each Stage
\item Monitor the Launching Mechanism
\end{itemize}
\item Flight Controller: wants to monitor the Pre-Launch Activities
\item Engineer/Technician:  wants to monitor Pre-Launch Data
\item Astronaut:  wants to monitor Pre-Launch Data
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Pre-Conditions:  }An appropriate Countdown Time is Entered
\textit{See Use Case 2:  the Flight Controller Shall Monitor the
Countdown}\\
\textbf{Post-Conditions:  }The Launch is Initiated\\\\
\textbf{Flow of Events:}\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{5.75cm}|p{5.75cm}|}\hline
\textbf{Flight Controller}&\textbf{System}\\\hline
1. Starts the Countdown \textit{See Use Case 2:  the Flight
Controller Shall Monitor the Countdown} & \\\hline
& 2. Periodically Monitors Pre-Launch Data\\\hline
& 3. Returns Launching Mechanism Pre-Launch Data\\\hline
& 4. Returns Rocket Pre-Lauch Data (all Rocket Stage Data)\\\hline
& 5. Returns Capsule Pre-Launch Data\\\hline
& 6. Countdown equals zero \textit{See Use Case 2:  the Flight
Controller Shall Monitor the Countdown}\\\hline
7. Initiate Launch Sequence & \\\hline
& 8.  Transitions to Launch Initiation\\\hline
& 9.  Iniiate Launch State\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Alternative Flows:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[2a-5a.]If the System detects an anamoly in the Pre-Launch Data,
then the System alerts the Flight Controller of the anomoly
\item[2b-5b.]If there System alerts the Flight Controller of a Pre-
Launch anomaly \textit{(See Alternative Flow 2a.)}, then the Flight
Controller can choose to hold the Countdown
\item[2c-5c.]If there is a hold in the Countdown and the anomaly is
resolved, then the Flight Controller can choose to resume the
Countdown, the Countdown continues at the stopped time \textit{See
Use Case 2:  The Flight Controller shall Monitor the Coundown}
\item[2d-5d.]If there is a hold in the Countdown, then the Flight
Controller can choose to abort the launch:  the System indicates an
aborted launch
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Special Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item There is only one decision point for the Abort:  the Flight
Controller
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Technology \& Variations List:}
\begin{itemize}
\item [4a.]The Pre-Launch Data is Rocket Model Dependent--hence,
the monitoring data and anomalies is Rocket Model Dependent
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Frequency of Occurence:  }Almost continuously:  based on the
number of desired Launches and Countdowns\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is considered ``anomalous" Countdown data?
\item Is ``anoalous" Countdown data depend upon the type of Launch
Vehicle and System (Launching Mechanism)?
\end{itemize}
