\title{The Lunar Mission Launch Simulator Initial Writeup}
\author{Lou Rosas}
\maketitle

\section{History}
Launching Simulators pose a unique challenge in implementation of
physics and real-time monitoring of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Current Speed
\item Current Altitude
\item Current Drag Coefficient
\item Current Position relative to Earth
\item Current Fuel Content
\item Current Stage
\begin{enumerate}
\item When Staging should occur
\end{enumerate}
\item Current End of Lauch Sequence
\begin{enumerate}
\item When the Capsule is in stable orbit?
\item When all of the Stages are completely finished?
\item When the Capsule is actually in space?
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
All of these pose particular issues as related to accurately
simulating a launch.
