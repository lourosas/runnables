\textbf{Use Case 1:  Monitor Pre-Launch}\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }Monitor Delivery System--Monitor Stage\\
\textbf{Scope:  }LaunchSimulator\\
\textbf{Level:  }Flight Controller Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }Flight Controller\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }None\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interrests:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Flight Controller:  Wants to monitor the entire stage data during
Pre-Launch for Pre-Launch validity (continue, hold or abort Pre-Launch)
\item Engineer/Technicians:  Wants to monitor the stage data during
Pre-Launch to aprise the Flight Controller to the condition of the
Stage
\item Astronaut:  Wants to monitor the stage data during pre-launch
for mission integrity
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Pre-Conditions:  }The Countdown has started, in Pre-Launch\\\\
\textbf{Post-Conditions:  }The Countdown at 0, the System transitioned
to Initiate Launch\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:}\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{5.75cm}|p{5.75cm}|}\hline
\textbf{Flight Controller} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
& 1.  Monitors the Pre-Launch Engine Data\\\hline
