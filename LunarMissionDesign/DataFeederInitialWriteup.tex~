\section{History}
Simulations (mechanical \& computerized) are an essential part of the
modern development process.  It is often done for
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cost of Effectiveness
\item Safety
\item Proof of Concept
\item Ease
\item Speed
\end{enumerate}
A full prototype does not need development:  allowing for all of the
above

\section{Abstract}
The System is to be tested in Simulation Mode.  Simulation mode, is
to model real events and data in as accurate a model as possible.
Since the System is data driven, that means a Simulation must
emulate real events via data.  Hence the Simulation is Data Driven,
in addition.

\section{Concept}
Create a Data Feeder that emulates data for all components in all
phases (states) of the Sytem to the point the System and Stake Holders
are ignorant to the fact the data is simulated and not an actual
mission.

\section{Intent}
Create a Data Feeder specifically designed to work with the Lunar
Simulator.  The purpose of the Data Feeder is to Feed Data (actually
be the Simulator for the Lunar Simulator/System) When data from actual
hardware is not available.

\noindent
\\Feed all the data related to the Lunar Sequence in all the Phases
(States) to the System.

\noindent
\\While the System is running in Simulation, the Data Feeder will feed
the appropriate data to the System via System Requests of the desired
Data.  Future development may require the System is \underline{alerted}
to the State Changes so as to ensure the System and Stakeholders are
agnostic to the source of the incomming data.

\noindent
\\The data modeled by the Data Feeder is independent of System
Request.

\noindent
\\The Data Feeder will calculate all the needed System Data for
the aggregate components for every phase (State) in the System.
