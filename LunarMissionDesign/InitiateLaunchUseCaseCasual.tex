\textbf{Initiate Launch}\\
\textit{Main Success Scenario}
\begin{enumerate}
\item System indicates the Countdown at 0 and ready to launch
\item Flight Controller Initiates Launch
\item System directs Engines to ignite
\item System returns confirmation of engine ignition
\item System monitors the Launch Data
\item System returns the Launch Data to the Flight Controller
\item System informs the Flight Controller the Rocket is ready to
launch
\item Flight Controller commands the System to launch the Rocket
\item System launches the Rocket (Launch mechanism)
\item System transitions to Launch upon the Rocket clearing the Launch
Tower
\end{enumerate}
\textit{Alternative Scenarios}
\begin{itemize}
\item[*] If Use Case is fully automated,
then the System Initiates the Launch, assess when to launch the
Rocket, and commands the physical activites to launch the Rocket.  The
Flight controller has the ability to manuall override and take control
as needed
\item[1a.]  Based on the data provided, the System advises the Flight
Director on Launch Viability
\item[2a.]  The Flight Controller can chose not Initiate the Launch
\item[4a.]  If the Engines do not ignite, then the System alerts the
Flight Controller, the Flight Controller aborts the Launch
\item [5a., 6a., 7a.]  If the System indicates an error in the Launch
Data,
then the System alerts the Flight Controller of the issue, with data
and recomendation (abort or not abort
the Launch).
\item[8a., 9a]  The Flight Controller can abort the Launch, the System
will not activate the Launch Mechanism
\item[10a.]  In the event of a Launch Abort, the System will not
transition to Launch
\end{itemize}
