\textbf{Use Case 4:  Enter State/Substate}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Data Feeder\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }None\\
\textbf{Secondary Actor:  }(Lunar Mission)System\\
\textbf{Related use Cases:  }None\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interrests:}
\begin{itemize}
   \item (Lunar Mission)System:  Wants data relevant to the
      State/Substate
   \item Flight Contoller:  Wants System data approprete to the
      State/Substate
   \item Engineer/Technician:  Wants the System data appropriate to
      the State/Substate
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Pre-Conditions:  }(Lunar Mission)System is started, Data
Feeder is started\\
\textbf{Post-Conditions: }The Data Feeder transition to the requested
State\\\\
\textbf{Flow of Events:}\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{5.75cm}|p{5.75cm}|}\hline
   \textbf{System Administrator}&\textbf{Data Feeder}\\\hline
   1.  Changes State/Substate &\\\hline
   2.  Notifies of State/Substate Change&\\\hline
   &3.  Changes State/Substate\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\textbf{Alternative Flows/Extensions:}
\begin{itemize}
   \item[3a]If the Data Feeder determines if the State/Substate
      transition is not waranted, then the Data Feeder does not
      transition to the new State/Substate--staying in its current
      State/Substate
