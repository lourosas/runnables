requested data.
\end{enumerate}
\textit{Alternative Scenarios}

   \item[1a]  If the data is not available then the Data Feeder
      returns an error
   \item[1b]  If the there is an error in acquiring the data, then

\end{enumerate}
\textit{Notes/Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item[2a]  If the querry rate is faster than the Data Feeder update
