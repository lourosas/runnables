\textbf{Use Case 1:  Monitor Pre-Launch Activities}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Launch Simulator\\
\textbf{Level:  }Flight Director Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }Flight Director\\
\textbf{Secondary Actor:  }Astronaut, Engineer/Technician\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }None\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interrests:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item Flight Controller:  wants to monitor the Pre-Launch Data
\item Flight Controller:  wants to monitor the Countdown Time
\item Flight Controller:  wants to asses the validity of the Countdown
\begin{itemize}
\item Continue the Countdown
\item Hold the Countdown
\item Abort the Countdown
\end{itemize}
\item Engineer/Technician:  wants to montior selected Pre-Launch data
to ensure the System is working properly and advise the Flight
Controller
\item Astronaut:  wants to monitor Countdown Time
\item Astronaut:  wants to monitor Pre-Launch Data for System
awareness
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Pre-Conditions:  }All the parts of the System are ready to
begin the Countdown, the Launch Simulator is running\\
\textbf{Post-Conditions:  }The Countdown is at zero, the System
transitioned from Pre-Launch to Initiate Launch\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:  }\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{5.75cm}|p{5.75cm}|}\hline
\textbf{Flight Director} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Start the Pre-Launch Sequence & \\\hline
& 2. Request Countdown Time Entry\\\hline
3.  Enters the Countdown Time & \\\hline
& 4.  Returns Countdown Time\\\hline
5.  Starts the Countdown  & \\\hline
& 6.  Displays Countdown Time to all actors\\\hline
& 7.  Repeats 6 for the entire countdown\\\hline
& 8.  Monitors Pre-Launch Data\\\hline
& 9. Returns Pre-Launch Data to all the actors\\\hline
& 10.  Repeats 7,8 for the entire Countdown\\\hline
& 11.  Alerts actors when Countdown reaches zero\\\hline
12.  Initiate Launch Sequence & \\\hline
& 13.  Transitions out of Pre-Launch into Intiate Launch\\\hline
& 14.  Informs the actors of the transition\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Alternative Flows:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item[*.a]  At anytime, the Flight Director can hold the Countdown
if conditions arise that warant that.
\item[*.b] At anytime, if the Countdown is on hold, the Filight
Director can resume the Countdown if the State of the System warants
such a transition;  the Countdown continues at the time stopped
