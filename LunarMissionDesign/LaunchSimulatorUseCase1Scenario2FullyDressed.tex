\textbf{Use Case 1:  Monitor Pre-Launch}\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }Monitor the Launching Mechanism\\
\textbf{Scope:  }LaunchSimulator\\
\textbf{Level:  }Flight Controller Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }Flight Controller\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }None\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interrests:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Flight Contoller:  Wants to monitor the Launching Mechanism to
determine the validity of the Pre-Launch (continue, hold or abort)
\item Engineer/Technitians:  Wants to monitor the Launching System 
during pre-launch to ensure the the System Integrity
\item Astronaut:  Wants to monitor the Launching System to monitor the
Launching System Integrity
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Pre-Conditions:  }The Countdown has started, and in
Pre-Launch\\\\
\textbf{Post-Conditions: }The Countdown at 0, the System transiitoned
to Initiate Launch\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:}\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{5.75cm}|p{5.75cm}|}\hline
\textbf{Flight Controller} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
& 1.  Reports the weight of the rocket\\\hline
& 2.  Reports the directions of the Forces\\\hline
& 3.  Reports the magintude of the forces at each support\\\hline
& 4.  Repeats 1 through 3 for the durration of the Countdown\\\hline
& 5.  Reports Countdown at 0\\\hline
6.  Initiate Launch &\\\hline
& 7.  Transitions to Initiate Launch\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Alternative Flows:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item[1a.]If the System reports anomalies in rocket weight, then the
System reports the Anomalies to the Flight Controller.  Flight
Controller determines course of action.
\item[2a.]If the System reports anomalies in the direction of the
rocket forces (upward force when should be down, wrong directoin of the
force), then the System reports the anomaly to the Flight Controller,
Flight Controller determines course of action.
\item[3a.]If the System reports unbalanced forces (unbalanced weight
distribution) in the rocket, then the System reports the anomaly to the
Flight Controller, Flight Controller determines course of action.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Special Requiements:  }None\\\\
\textbf{Technology \& Variations List:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item The Launching Mechanism supports the weight of the rocket. Force
measurement will vary
\item Force measurements and anomaly determination depends on mechanism
\item This is literally a vectoral measurement
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Frequency of Occurence: }Depends on the frequency of the
launch\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item What constitutes an anomalous pre-launch force measurement?
\item What constitutes an anomalous pre-launch direction mesurement?
\end{itemize}
