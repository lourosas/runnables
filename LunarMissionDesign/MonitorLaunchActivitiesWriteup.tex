\textbf{Monitor Launch Activities Goal Writeup}\\\\
\textbf{Actor:  }Flight Control Director\\
Starting with the Launch Countdown, and continuing through the final
stage separation, the Flight Control Director (Flight Controller)
monitors the Launch Activities.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Monitor Pre-Launch Activities
\item Initiate Launch (at least monitor Launch Initiation)
\item Monitor Launch Activities
\end{enumerate}
What does it mean to ``Monitor Pre-Launch Activities"?\\
Up until the Launch Initialization (countdown reaches 0):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Monitor the Countdown
\item Monitor the Data Important to a launch
\item Communicate with flight engineers about launch data
\item Communicate with Astronauts about the launch data
\item Select which launch data is important enough to view for more
scutiny
\end{enumerate}
What happens if the System Reports a problem (Capsule, Rocket,
Fuel Delivery, etc.)?\\
The Flight Controller can chose to
\begin{enumerate}
\item Hold the Countdown--The Flight Controller can chose to resume
the countdown.  If the Flight Controller choses to resume the
countdown,
the countdown continues at the place it was stopped.
\item Scrub the Launch--The Pre-requisite of this is \textbf{Hold the
Countdown}.  Once the Flight Controller holds the Countdown, the
Flight Controller can chose to Scrub the Launch:  At which point the
Countdown is eliminated.
\end{enumerate}
Is the Countdown automated?\\
The Countdown must be initialized by the Flight Controller and only the
Flight Controller,  the Launch Initializatoin can be automated.\\\\
Can the Flight Controller view all the Mission Data simultaneously?\\
Yes\\\\
Can the Flight Controller chose which Mission Data to view?\\
Yes, the Flight Controller can chose Mission Data to focus their
attention.  The Flight Controller can change that during the Pre-Launch
Activities\\\\
What does it mean to ``Initiate Launch" or ``Monitor Launch
Initiation"?\\
Once the Countdown reaches 0, the Launch is initialized.  This means
the Countdown cannot be aborted (only the Launch) and the engine
ignition is complete.  Once Started, the engines cannot be stopped.
The System monitors the mission data, and once the System determines
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Engine thrust is stable
\item The Engine thrust is high enough to lift the Rocket and Payload
\item The Fuel Delivery System is stable
\end{enumerate}
The System Lauches the Rocket (or advises the Flight Controller to
release the Rocket) by releasing the holds on the Rocket preventing it
from thrusting up.  The Initiate Launch Activities are completed once
the Rocket clears the Launching Tower.\\\\
If the System determines the Rocket is not in
a stable state for lauch, the System will advise the Flight Controller
to abort the Launch--or abort the Lauch automatically (depending
on it control of the System).\\\\
What does it mean to ``Monitor Launch Activities"?\\
Monitoring the Data pertaining to the Launch.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Monitor Data important to the Launch
\item Communicate with the flight engineers about the laucnch data
\item Select which launch data is important enough to view for more
scrutiny
\end{enumerate}
This is all similar to the \textbf{Monitor Pre-Launch Activities}.
Once the capsules/payload
separates from the final stage, the Launch is complete.\\\\
The System advises the Filght Controller on the Stability of the
launch:  advising the the Filght Controller to abort the Launch, and/or
aborting the Launch based on the control offered the System
if the Launch is unstable (as similar to \textbf{Monitor Pre-Launch
Activities}).
