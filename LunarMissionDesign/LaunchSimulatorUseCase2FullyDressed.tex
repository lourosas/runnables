\textbf{Use Case 2:  Iniate Launch}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Launch Simulator\\
\textbf{Level:  }Flight Controller Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }Flight Controller\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }\textit{Use Case 1:  The Users shall
monitor Pre-Launch Activities}\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interrests:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item Flight Controller:  wants to initiate Launch
\item Astronaut:  wants successful Launch
\item Flight Controller:  wants a successful Launch
\item Administrator:  wants a successful Launch
\item Local and Federal Politicians:  want a successful Launch for
campaign, re-election and other political purposes
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Pre-Conditions:  }All Pre-Launch Activities are complete:  the
Countdown is at Zero, there is no hold nor abort on the Countdown, the
System indicates no errors in the Pre-Launch Data\\
\textbf{Post-Conditions:  }The Trasistion to Launch successful\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:  }\\

\textbf{Alternative Flows:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[4a]If the Engines do not ignite, then the System Alerts the
Flight Controller of the issue, the Flight Controller aborts the
laumch and all the actors follow their repsective Launch Abort
Procedures
\item[5a-7a]If, after an expected time for the Engine Thrust to be
adequate enough to lift the Rocket, the Engine thrust is not adequate
enough to lift the Rocket, then the System alerts the Flight Controller
of the Engine inadequancy with recomendation (abort/not abort Launch).
\item[9a]If the Flight Controller aborts the Launch, the
System will not activate the Launch Mechinism, all the actors are to
follow their respective Launch Abort Procedures.
\item[15a]In the event of a Launch Abort, the System will not
transition to Launch
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Special Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Launch Initialization is from when the Flight Director
Initiates the Launch Sequence to when the Rocket Clears the Launch
Tower.  The Flight Director has the ability to Abort the Lauch
Initialization.  Special Abort Procedures must be developed and
followed by the Flight Controller, and the Astronauts.
\item Several factors and data points are required to determine
if/when the Rocket is ready to Launch.  The System will monitor all
of these factors.  All of these factors must be in a stable and
exprected state before the System will advise on launching the Rocket.
\item There is only one point of Decision for the Abort.  That decision
rests with the Flight Controller.  Currently, the Flight Controller
takes no advisement other than System Data.
\item The Launch Mechanism will not release the delivery system
(rocket) until enough lift thrust is built up.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Technology \& Variations List}
\begin{itemize}
\item[*] The Launch Initialization data can be viewed simultaneously,
or chose to view selected Pre-Launch data, at the discretion of the Flight
Controller.
\item[*]  If the System is automated, then the System would determine
when to ignite the engines, when  to execute the Launching
Mechanism, and make the decision to abort the Launch Sequence.  The
Flight Director would have final authority.
\item[2a]The Flight Controller can chose not to Initiate the Launch
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Frequency of Occurrence:  }Almost continuoulsy.  Based on the
Frequency of desired Launches.\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item Need to create a list of the Lauch Data to monitor:  needed for
the decision for when to launch the Rocket
\item What are the abort procedures?
\item Consider shutting down the Rocket engines as part of the abort
procedures
\item If the Rocket engines are not capable of shutdown, consider
other possible abort procedures
\item Should the Astronauts have the ability to abort the Launch
initialization?
\item If the Engine thrust is inadequate to lift the to launch and
the Flight Director executes the Launch Rocket procedure, should there
be a System Override where the Launching Mechanism is not executed?
\end{itemize}
