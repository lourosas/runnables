\textbf{Initialize Launch Data}\\
\textit{Main Success Scenario}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Flight Controller Enters the Rocket Data
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Model Number
\item The Number of Stages
\item Initial Data
\item For each Stage, the Flight Controller enters the initial Stage
data
\item For each Stage, the Flight Controller enters the threshold Stage
data
\end{enumerate}
\item System Saves the Rocket \& Stage Initialization Data
\item System Displays the Rocket \& Stage Data to the Actors
\item The Flight Controller Enters the Launching Platform Data
\begin{enumerate}
\item Number of Supports
\item Total threshold data
\item For each Support, the Flight Controller enters the intial
support data
\item System calculates the Support Threshold Data for each support
based on the Individual Support initialization data
\end{enumerate}
\item System saves the Launching Platform Initialization \&
Threshold Data
\item For each Support, System saves the individual Support
initialization \& threshold data to the Actors
\item System Displays the Launching Platform Initialization \&
Threshold Data to the Actors
\item For each Support, System displays the individual Support
initialization \& threshold data
\item Flight Controller enters the initial \& threshold Capsule data
\item System Saves the initial \& threshold Capsule data
\item System displays the Capsule initialial \& threshold data
\end{enumerate}
\textit{Alternative Scenarios}
\begin{itemize}
\item[*] There are many ways for the Flight Controller to enter
the appopriate initialization data, and is independent to the Use
Case.
\item[*] The System displays default data for any errant data (entered
or otherwise), alerting the Actors of the errant data.
\item[*] If the System is unable to save the data, then the System
alerts the Actors to the issue.
\end{itemize}
