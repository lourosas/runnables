\textbf{Use Case 1:  Monitor Pre-Launch}\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }Monitor the Countdown\\
\textbf{Scope:  }LaunchSimulator\\
\textbf{Level:  }Flight Controller Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }Flight Controller\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }None\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interrests:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item Flight Controller: wants to control the countdown as part of
 the Launch
\item  Engineer/Technitcian:  wants to know the Current Countdown Time
\item Astronaut:  wants to know the Current Countdown Time
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Pre-Conditions:  }The System is running and ready to begin
the Countdown and enter Pre-Launch\\\\
\textbf{Post-Conditions:  }The Countdown Time is entered\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:  }\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{5.75cm}|p{5.75cm}|}\hline
\textbf{Flight Conroller} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Start Pre-Launch Sequence &\\\hline
& 2.  Request Countdown Time Entry\\\hline
3.  Enters Countdown &\\\hline
& 4.  Reflects the Countdown Time Entered\\\hline
5.  Starts the Countdown &\\\hline
& 6. Starts the Countdown Clock\\\hline
& 7. Transitions to Pre-Launch\\\hline
& 8.  Periodically Updates  and displays the Countdown Time for the
entire Countdown\\\hline
& 9.  Alerts the Actors when the Countdown reaches zero\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Alternative Flows:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item[*]At anytime, the Flight Controller can hold the countdown; this
hold may or may not be due to a System Anomaly/Error.
\item[*]At anytime, if the Countdown is on hold, the Flight Controller
can resume the Countdown;  the Countdown continues at the time stopped
\item[*]At anytime, if the Countdown is on hold, the Flight Controller
can chose to abort the Countdown.  the System responds by abandoning
the Countdown
\item[3a.]  If the Flight Controller enters an unacceptable Countdown
Time ($time < 0$), the System refuses to set the time:  intstructing
the Flight Controller to enter an acceptable time
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Special Requirements:}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Only the Flight Controller can abort the Countdown.  The rest of
the Stakeholders have input
\item The entered Countdown must be $>= 1$ hour
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Technology \& Variations List:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[*]All Actors can view the Countdown Time
\item[3b,4a.]The Flight Controller can change the Countdown time as
desired prior to starting the Cuonddown.
\item[3c,4b]Once the Countdown is starrted,  the Countdown time cannot
 be changed.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Frequency of Occurence:  }Almost continuously\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can the Coutdown be Aborted without the Hold?
\item What happens if the Countdown Timer fails?
\end{itemize}
