\textbf{Enter State, Substate--Casual Format}\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item With the Data Feeder running
   \item With the System Running and periodically requesting data from
      the Data Feeder
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item The System may periodically change State and Substate
         \item The System notifies the Data Feeder of the State Change
         \item The Data Feeder assess the Change Request from the
            System and determines its relevance to the Data Feeder
            \begin{enumerate}
               \item If the Data Feeder deterimines the State/Substate
                  change is relevant to the Data Feeder, then the
                  Data Feeder changes its State/Substate to reflect
                  the requesting System 
            \end{enumerate}
      \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\textit{Alternative Scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item[2a] If the Data Feeder determines the State/Sustate Change
      is not important to the Data Feeder, then the Data Feeder will
      not change its State
\end{enumerate}
\textit{Notes/Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item[2b] Illegal State/Substate transitions weeded out by the
      System by the time the request reaches the Data Feeder.
\end{enumerate}
