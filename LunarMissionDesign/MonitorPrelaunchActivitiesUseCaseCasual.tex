\textbf{Monitor Pre-launch}\\
\textit{Main Success Scenario}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Flight Controller Starts the Pre-Launch Sequence
\item The System requests the Countdown Time \textit{See Monitor
Countdown Use Case}
\item System periodically monitors Pre-Launch Data
\item System returns Pre-Launch Data to the Flight Controller
\item System alerts the Flight Controller when the countdown reaches
   zero \textit{See Monitor Countdown Use Case}
\item Flight Controller Initiates the Launch Sequence
\item System Intiates Launch and Transitions to Initiate Launch
\item System returns the Initiate Launch
\end{enumerate}
\textit{Alternate Scenarios}
\begin{itemize}
\item[3a.]  If the System detects an anomaly in the Pre-Launch
Data, then the System alerts the Flight Controller of the anomaly
\item[4a.]  If the System alerts the Flight Controller of a Pre-Launch
anomaly (see \textit{Alternative Scenario 3a.}) then the Flight
Controller can chose to hold the Countdown
\item[4b.]  If there is a hold in the Countdown and the anomaly is
resolved, then the Flight Controller can chose to resume the
Countdown, the Countdown continues at the time stopped \textit{See
Monitor Pre-Launch Use Case}
\item[4c.]  If there is a hold in the Countdown, then the Flight
Controller can chose to abort the launch the System indicates an
aborted launch \textit{See Monitor Pre-Launch Use Case}
