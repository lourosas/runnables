\textbf{Monitor Pre-launch Activities}\\
\textit{Main Success Scenario}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Flight Controller Starts the Pre-Launch Sequence
\item The System requests the Countdown Time
\item The Flight Controller enters the Countdown Time
\item System displays the Countdown Time
\item Flight Controller Starts the Countdown
\item System continuously displays the Countdown Time
\item System periodically monitors Pre-Launch Data
\item System returns Pre-Launch Data to the Flight Controller
\item System alerts the Flight Controller when the countdown reaches 0
\item Flight Controller Initiates the Launch Sequence
\end{enumerate}
\textit{Alternate Scenarios}
\begin{itemize}
\item[7a.]  If the System detects an anomaly in the Pre-Launch
Data, then the System alerts the Flight Controller of the anomaly
\item[8a.]  If the System alerts the Flight Controller of a Pre-Launch
anomaly (see \textit{Alternative Scenario 7a.}) then the Flight
Controller can chose to hold the Countdown
\item[8b.]  If there is a hold in the Countdown and the anomaly is
resolved, then the Flight Controller can chose to resume the
Countdown, the Countdown continues at the time stopped
\item[8c.]  If there is a hold in the Countdown, then the Flight
Controller can chose to abort the launch the System indicates an
aborted launch
\item[7b. 8d.]  If the System is automated at countdown, and the
System detects an anomaly, then the System can hold the Countdown of
which the Flight Controller can override
\item[9a. 10a.] If the System is automated at countdown then the
System will initiate the Launch Sequence (per the Flight
Controller's setting) 
\end{itemize}
