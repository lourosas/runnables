\textbf{Use Case 3: Manage Power}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Coffee Maker\\
\textbf{Level:  }Coffee Drinker Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }Coffee Drinker\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }\textit{Power Coffee Maker Off}\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }None\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interrests:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item Coffee Drinker:  who wants to turn the Coffee Maker off
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }Coffee Maker is powered on.\\
\textbf{Postconditions:  }Coffee Maker is power off.  Coffee Maker is
reflecting the Current State of its components.\\
\textbf{Success Guarantees:  }The Coffee maker is off (no power is
applied)\\\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{5.75cm}|p{5.75cm}|}\hline
\textbf{Coffee Drinker} & \textbf{Coffee Maker}\\\hline
1.  Removes Power to the Coffee Maker (turns Coffee Maker off) &
    \\\hline
& 2.  Indicates Power is off\\\hline
& 3.  Sets up to accept Coffee Drinker input: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Pull Carafe
\item Fill Reservoir
\end{enumerate}
\\\hline
& 4.  Indicates the amount of water in the Reservoir\\\hline
& 5.  Indicates the amount of coffee in the Carafe\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Extensions (Alternative Flows):}
\begin{itemize}
\item[3a.]If the Carafe is in the \textit{Pulled} State, then the
Coffee Maker Accepts
\begin{enumerate}
\item Return Carafe
\item Fill Reservoir
\item Pour
\end{enumerate}
as Coffee Drinker input.
\item[3b.]If the Carafe is in the \textit{Pouring} State, then the
Coffee Maker Accepts
\begin{enumerate}
\item Stop Pouring
\item Fill Reservoir
\end{enumerate}
as Coffee Drinker input.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Special Requirements:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item The Power to the Coffee Maker Must be one
\item Regardless of Carafe State, the Coffee Maker does not have the
 options to Brew coffee when the Coffee Maker has no power.
\item The State of the Carafe must be known.
\item The Amount in the Reservoir must be known.
\item The Amount in the Carafe must be known.
\end{itemize}
