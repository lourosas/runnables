\textbf{Use Case 2: Get Coffee}\\
\textbf{Scope: }Coffee Maker\\
\textbf{Level: }Coffee Drinker Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor: }Coffee Drinker\\
\textbf{Scenario: }None\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }\textit{Use Case 1:  The Coffee Drinker
shall brew Coffee}\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interrests: }
\begin{itemize}
\item Coffee Drinker:  wants coffee
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions: }There is Coffee in the carafe\\
\textbf{Postconditions: }Coffee is poured into a mug(cup).  The amount
of coffee in the carafe is less by at least the amount poured into the
mug(cup).\\
\textbf{Success Guarantees: }The Coffee Drinker has Coffee\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:  }\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{5.75cm}|p{5.75cm}|}\hline
\textbf{Coffee Drinker} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Pulls the carafe & \\\hline
2.  Gets a Mug(Cup) & \\\hline
3.  Pours Coffee & \\\hline
 & 4. Empties the Carafe\\\hline
 & 5. Fills the Mug(Cup)\\\hline
6. Stops pouring coffee & \\\hline
7. Returns the carafe & \\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Extensions (Alternative Flows): }
\begin{itemize}
\item[1a.] If the Carafe is already pulled, then the Coffee Drinker
waits until the Carafe is reuturned.
\item[4a.,5a.] If the Carafe runs out of coffee, the the Carafe stops
emptying into the Mug(Cup), and the Mug(Cup) stops filling.
\item[4b.5b.]If the mug(cup) is full and the carafe continues to
empty, then no more coffee is added to the mug(cup)--coffee spills
onto the floor.
\item[4c.5c.]If the mug(cup) is full and the carafe continues to
empty, then the amount of coffee in the carafe continues to decrese
until the carafe is empty or the Coffee Drinker stops pouring.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Special Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[--]none
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Technology \& Variations List:}
\begin{itemize}
\item none
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Frequency of Occurrence:  }Dependent upon the availability of
brewed coffee (see \textit{Use Case 1:  The Coffee Drinker shall
brew Coffee}).\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item[--]The size of the carafe is variable
\item[--]The size of the mug(cup) is variable
\item[--]What about multiple fillings of multiple different
mugs(cups)?
