\textbf{Use Case 1: Brew Coffee}\\
\textbf{Scope: }Coffee Maker\\
\textbf{Level: }Coffee Drinker Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor: }Coffee Drinker\\
\textbf{Scenario: }None\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases: }\textit{Use Case 2:  The Coffee Drinker
shall get Coffee}\\\textit{Use Case 3:  The Coffee Drinker shall add
water to the Reservoir}\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interrests: }
\begin{itemize}
\item Coffee Drinker: wants coffee
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions: }Power is supplied to the Coffee Maker.
The Coffee Drinker already added fresh coffee. Water is added to the
Reservoir (See \textit{Use Case 3:  The Coffee Drinker shall add water
to the Coffee Maker})\\
\textbf{Postconditions: }Coffee is brewed, in the Carafe and ready for
serving.\\
\textbf{Success Guarantees: }The System brews the coffee.\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario: }\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{5.75cm}|p{5.75cm}|}\hline
\textbf{Coffee Drinker} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Start the Brewing Process &\\\hline
& 2. Brews the coffee\\\hline
& 3. Alerts Coffee Drinker when brewing complete\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Extensions (Alternative Flows): }
\begin{itemize}
\item[1a.]
If there is no Water in the Reservoir, then the System alerts the
Coffee Drinker to add Water (See \textit{Use Case 3:  The Coffee
Drinker shall add Water to the Reservoir}).
\item[2a.]
If the Coffee Drinker pulls the carafe before the Coffee Maker
is finished brewing the coffee, then Coffee Maker stops brewing,
continuing once the carafe is returned (under the spigot).
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Special Requirements:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item [--]As stated in the Assumptions, the Coffee Drinker adding
coffee
is not modeled in this Use Case; since this Use Case addressed brewing
coffee, the brew behavior will continue regardless of the addition of
unbrewed coffee grounds.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Technology \& Data Variations List: }
\begin{itemize}
\item[2a.] Predict the adding ability of choice to the Coffee Drinker
to automate coffee brewing in future upgrades and improvements.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Frequency of Occurrence: } Dependent upon the brewing time
combined with the demand of Coffee Drinkers.\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues: }
\begin{itemize}
\item[--]The size of the carafe is variable
\item[--]What about a Coffee Maker with multiple carafes?  Would that
alter the 3a Alternative Flows?
\end{itemize}
