\textbf{Brew Coffee}\\
\textit{Main Success Scenario:  }
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Coffee drinker puts the coffee in the coffee maker
   \item Coffee drinker puts the wather in the coffee maker
   \item Coffee drinker indicates to(messages) the coffee maker to
   brew the coffee
   \item Coffee maker brews the coffee
   \item (Optional) Coffee maker alerts when done brewing the coffee
\end{enumerate}
\textit{Alternative Scenarios:  }
\begin{enumerate}
\item[3a] If the coffee drinker pulls the carafe before the coffee
        maker is finished brewing (see \textit{Use Case 2:  Get
        Coffee}), then one of two scenarios can take place. 1) The 
        coffee continues brewing coffee, 2) The Coffee stops brewing
        until the coffee drinker puts the carafe back in its place.
\item[5a] This is optional, if there is no alert, then it is up to the
        coffee drinker to check when the coffee is done.  If there is
        an alert, then the coffee maker somehow alerts.
\end{enumerate}
