\textbf{Get Coffee}\\
\textit{Main Success Scenario:  }
\begin{enumerate}
\item Coffee drinker pulls the carafe
\item Coffee drinker gets a mug (cup)
\item Coffee drinker pours coffee into mug (cup)
\item Coffee drinker puts the carafe back
\end{enumerate}
\textit{Alternate Scenarios:  }
\begin{enumerate}
\item[3a] If the carafe is or becomes empty, then the mug (cup) stops
filling (this should be obvious)
\item[3b] If the coffee drinker continues to pour coffee into a mug
that is full (at capacity), then the mug(cup) will not take in the
extra coffee (the mug(cup) will overflow--again, should be obvious)
\item[2a, 3c] A coffee drinker can get more than one mug (in sequence)
and continue to fill as fill mugs(cups) as long as there is coffee
in the carafe (see \textit{item 3a above})
\end{enumerate}
