\textbf{Use Case 3: Manage Power}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Coffee Maker\\
\textbf{Level:  }Coffee Drinker Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }Coffee Drinker\\
\textbf{Scenario: }\textit{Power Coffee Maker On}\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }None\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interrests:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item Coffee Drinker:  who wants to brew coffee
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }Coffee Maker is powered off\\
\textbf{Postconditions:  }Coffee Makeer is powered on.  Coffee Maker
is reflecting the current State of the Coffee Maker and its
components.\\
\textbf{Success Guarantees:  }Power is applied to the Coffee Maker\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:  }\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{5.75cm}|p{5.75cm}|}\hline
\textbf{Coffee Drinker} & \textbf{Coffee Maker}\\\hline
1.  Applies Power to the Coffee Maker & \\\hline
& 2.  Indicates Power is Applied\\\hline
& 3.  Indicates in the Brewing State\\\hline
& 4.  Indicates the Carafe State
\begin{enumerate}
\item Home--in the Coffee Maker
\item Pulled--away from the Coffee Maker
\item Pouring--pouring out the Carafe's contents
\end{enumerate}
\\\hline
& 5.  Indicates the Current State of the Reservoir (the amount of
water in the Reservoir)\\\hline
& 6.  Indicates the amount of coffee in the Carafe\\\hline
& 7.  Sets up to accept Coffee Drinker input:
\begin{enumerate}
\item To Brew Coffee
\item To Get the Carafe
\item To Fill the Reservoir
\end{enumerate}
\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Extensions (Alternative Flows):}
\begin{itemize}
\item[7a.]If the Carafe is currently in the Pulled State, then the
Coffee Maker accepts
\begin{enumerate}
\item Brew Coffee
\item Return Carafe
\item Fill Reservoir
\item Pour
\end{enumerate}
as Coffee Drinker input.
\item[7b.]If the Carafe is currently in the Pouring (emptying its
contents) State, the Coffee Maker accepts
\begin{enumerate}
\item Brew Coffee
\item Fill Reservoir
\item Stop Pouring
\end{enumerate}
as Coffee Drinker input.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Special Requirements: }
\begin{itemize}
\item Power to the Coffee Maker must be off
\item The State of the Carafe must be known
\item The amount of the Reservoir must be known
\end{itemize}
